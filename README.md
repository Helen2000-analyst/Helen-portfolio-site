# Helen-Car-Pivot-Sales-Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)

## Project Objective

- To analyze car sales data and identify trends across make, model, color, price, cost, and mileage.
- To evaluate the relationship between vehicle color and pricing/mileage to understand customer preferences.
- To compare sales performance by car make and model and identify high- and low-performing categories.
- To provide actionable insights that support pricing strategies, inventory planning, and sales optimization.
- To design an interactive dashboard that enables stakeholders to make data-driven decisions through filters and visual summaries.

## Process

- Verified data for any missing anomalities, and sort them out.

- Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format, data values used.

- Created pivot tables according to the question asked.

- Merged all pivot tables into onedashboard and applied slicer to make it dynamic.

## Project Insights

- Overall bussiness performace: The dashboard shows a strong financial position, with the total selling price exceeding the total acquisition cost, indicating positive profitability. The business is generating healthy returns across its mix of car brands, colors, and models.

- Top Performing brand: Toyota, Honda, and Chevrolet consistently appear across the visualizations and display strong price performance. These brands contribute significantly to overall revenue and show reliable customer demand.

- Consumer's colour preference: Black and Green vehicles show high representation in both pricing and mileage segments. These colors appear to be strongly preferred by customers and are likely to sell faster. This suggests an opportunity to increase inventory in these specific color categories.

- Model Cost and Profitability: Models such as Accord, Camry, and Altima appear among the higher-cost acquisitions. While these models are popular, their higher cost structure may reduce profit margins unless paired with matching or premium selling prices.


## Recommendations

- Focus on High-Value Colors.
  
  - Silver, Black, and White show strong price and mileage contributions.
  - Prioritize stocking and promoting these colors, as they appear more profitable and popular.

- Mileage Management Strategy.
  
  - Brands like Chevrolet and Honda have higher total mileage.
  - Introduce mileage-based pricing tiers or warranties to maintain buyer confidence.

- Optimize Pricing by Make.
 
  - Ford, Honda, and Chevrolet record higher total prices.
  - Maintain competitive pricing for these brands and consider premium positioning for high-demand models.

- Cost Control on Low-Return Models.
  
  - Some models show higher costs but lower sales value.
  - Reassess procurement strategy for underperforming models to reduce overhead.

- Targeted Marketing.
  
  - Promote low-mileage, high-price vehicles in ads and campaigns.
  - Highlight “best value” cars using price-to-mileage ratios.

   

## Final conclusion

The dashboard shows that the car sales business is profitable, with selling prices exceeding total costs. Certain colors (Green, Black) and makes (Honda, Toyota, Chevrolet) demonstrate stronger performance, while mileage varies widely across cars. The charts and slicers help identify trends in price, cost, and mileage across different vehicle categories.
